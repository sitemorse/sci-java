# Sitemorse CMS Integration (SCI) java Client

This is a java implementation of a client for the SCI protocol that forms part of the Sitemorse **INCMS** service.

This software is open source but to perform a Sitemorse test requires a valid licence key. A licence key and protocol documentation can be obtained by contacting sales@Sitemorse.com

This client handles the protocol for Sitemorse **INCMS** Bloomreach, and **INCMS** WebCenter Sites connectors.

Other versions of this client are available in [php](https://github.com/sitemorse/sci-php) and c#.
